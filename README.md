# hangman.py
A non-graphical version of the popular game "Hangman" I created for use via the terminal as an exercise. There are two versions of it - one relies on a dictionary on Linux and does not run on other OS. The other picks a word from Frankenstein via Project Gutenberg and runs on most OS, but requires an internet connection and is slower to execute.
