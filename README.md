If you use the first version - you must have installed a dictionary under /usr/share/dict/words. Depending on your distibution, it may or may not be preinstalled. I prefer this version as it runs offline and executes faster, but if you are not on Linux or do not want to install the dictionary, it will not run.

The second version picks words from the first chapter of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein on Project Gutenberg, which means you need to be online, it is slower to execute and the pool of words is limited. However, it should run on most OS.

Regardless, this game was created for terminals. It can be run directly in your IDE, as well. It does not feature any graphics and is purely text-based.

Have fun with it!
